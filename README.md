This is a game project for CIS 3309.

CIS 3309 Game Project 
This project will give you experience applying all the skills you learned in class to build a complex software system using component-based software design principles. This project is also an exercise in team programming where you will form a team of 2 to complete the project. Your team needs to choose a game from the provided list. The game selection is on a first-come/first-served basis. You need to provide documentation for your project, and have the documents reviewed by me before you can begin implementing the game.  You will not be able to fully implement the game until we finish discussing databases in lecture, but you can still begin the project without using a database.
Game List:
Are you smarter than a 5th grader?
Battleship
Bingo
BlackJack
Concentation (Memory game)
ConnectFour
Deal or No Deal
Minesweeper (easy version)
Monopoly
Slot Machine
War card game
Who wants to be a millionaire?

Requirements:
You need to create a multi-form application that allows a single player to play against the computer or another human player depending on the game you choose. The program must store all relevant game statistics for each player of the game in a database, and it should keep track of all the players of the game. The program should use the information from the database to display either the highest scores, wins / loses, or other relevant game statistics on a separate form. Your program also needs to display the instructions on how to play the game.
The program should have a main screen that allows the user to choose the game type (1 player or 2 players)
You need to provide navigation between your forms.
Provide instructions to the user on how to play the game and how to use the application in a separate form.
The program should provide game statistics on a separate form.
The game should make choices randomly where needed 
Example: choosing cards, rolling the dice, making a move for the computer, ... 
The program should use images to make the game more attractive.
Example: show the images for the outcome of rolling the dice, show the images of the card, etcÎíÎõ
The program must use error handling and validate user input.
You need to create classes to model the important elements of the system to demonstrate component-based design. 
The game should be implemented as a class that manages all the elements of the game including the players, statistics, and the behavior of the game.
You need to create UnitTests for all the classes in the game.


Grading:
I will evaluate the program based on the documentation (planning phase), the implementation of the game, and how well you implemented component-based design in creating reusable component-based code. You need to make all the elements of the program reusable components with exception of the GUI.  I will also grade you on how well you worked as a team.  Each member of the group is responsible for an equal amount of work designing and coding the system.  You must prove that you done the work in order to received credit.
